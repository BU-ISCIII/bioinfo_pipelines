Author: Monzon S.
Version: 1.3

-- General Parameters --

- Installation directory.

installDir = /home/smonzon/Documentos/desarrollo/exome_pipeline

- Run parameters.

	· Select yes or no for preprocessing and alignment step. If alignment preprocessing is needed.
		Prep_ref = no
		Preprocessing = yes
		Alignment = yes

	· Select the variant caller you would like to use. [Samtools, GATK,
Strelka, VarScan or JointSNVMix]

		Postprocessing = Samtools

	· Select how many threads do you want to use on your computer (only
some of the programs use multithreading). Script not
	prepare for cluster running.

		THREADS = 4
		Control = S
		Case = T

- Software and output paths. Please, select the executable paths of the
  prerequisite software (more info in the user guide).

	BWA_PATH = /opt/bwa
	SAMTOOLS_PATH = /opt/samtools 
	STRELKA_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/strelka

	TEMP = test/temp
	RESULTS_DIR =  /home/smonzon/Documentos/desarrollo/exome_pipeline/test/result_test
	

- Files paths (full paths!!). Select the paths of your data. Required: data_path and ref_path
  always. Exome_enrichment for exome analysis and 1000 G files for gatk analysis.

	· Path to your fastq files. More info for preparing the folder in the
user guide.

		DATA_PATH = test/pruebas/RAW/cancer

	· Path to your ped file.
		PED_FILE = etc/triocaller.ped

	· Path to your reference genome.

		REF_PATH = /home/smonzon/Documentos/reference/homo_sapiens/1000genomes_b37/genome/human_g1k_v37.fasta

	· Path to bed file with the enrichment regions in your exome
experiment.

		EXOME_ENRICHMENT=etc/truseq_exome_targeted_regions.hg19.bed.chr

	· Data files from the 1000 G project. More info for downloading this
files in the user guide.

		SNPS_hg19 = /home/smonzon/Documentos/reference/homo_sapiens/1000genomes_b37/variants/20120605/dbsnp_135.b37.vcf
		HAPMAP_33= /home/smonzon/Documentos/reference/homo_sapiens/1000genomes_b37/variants/20120605/hapmap_3.3.b37.sites.vcf

-- Specific Parameters --

1. Preprocessing.

1.1. Trimming and Filter parameters.

	1.1.1 Trimming

	- Number of bases to be trimmed from left end (5' end). Default: 0

	leftTrimBases =  

	- Number of bases to be trimmed from right end (3' end). Default: 0

	rightTrimBases =

	- Cut-off PHRED quality score for trimming reads from right end (3'
	  end)
	For eg.: -q 20, will trim bases having PHRED quality score less than
20 at 3' end of the reads. 
	Note: Quality trimming can be performed only if -l and -r are not
used. Default: 0

	qualCutOff= 

	- Read length cut-off. Reads shorter than given length will be
	  discarded. Default: -1 
 
	lenCutOff =

	1.1.2. Filtering

	- The cut-off value for percentage of read length that should be of
	  given quality. Default: 70

	cutOffReadLen4HQ =

	- The cut-off value for PHRED quality score for high-quality
	  filtering. Default: 20

	cutOffQualScore =

1.2. Alignment Options.

	For mapping step bwa is used with default parameters for single and
paired en reads. More info in the user 
	guide.

2. Variant Calling.

2.1 Samtools

	minMapQ = 40
	minPhredQ = 30

2.2 VarScan

	Somatic Mutation Calling comparing control and tumor samples is
performed with default parameters.

2.3 GATK
	
	Use default options. See gatk.sh script for more information
	java_ram = 24

2.4 Strelka

	It has its own config.file, you will found it in
/etc/configStrelka.ini

2.5 JointSNVMix

	min_normal_depth = 5 
	skip_size = 100 
	min_tumour_depth = 5
	model = snvmix2 
	somatic_threshold = 0.2

3. Variant Analysis: Variant Effect Predictor.This program needs the
downloaded Ensembl database, look the user guide for
instructions. Put here the directory where the DB is placed (usually
/home/{user}/.vep)

	cacheDir = /home/smonzon/.vep
