-- General Parameters --

- Run parameters.

	· Select yes or no for preprocessing and alignment step.

		Preprocessing = yes

	· Select the variant caller you would like to use. [Samtools, GATK, Strelka, VarScan or JointSNVMix]

		Postprocessing = Samtools

	· Select how many threads do you want to use on your computer (only some of the programs use multithreading). Script not
	prepare for cluster running.

		THREADS = 7
		Control = S
		Case = T

- Software and output paths. Please, select the executable paths of the prerequisite software (more info in the user guide).

- Files paths. Select the paths of your data. Required: data_path and ref_path always. Exome_enrichment for exome analysis 
	and 1000 G files for gatk analysis.

	· Path to your fastq files. More info for preparing the folder in the user guide.

-- Specific Parameters --

1. Preprocessing.

1.1. Trimming and Filter parameters.

	1.1.1 Trimming

	- Number of bases to be trimmed from left end (5' end). Default: 0

	leftTrimBases =  

	- Number of bases to be trimmed from right end (3' end). Default: 0

	rightTrimBases =

	- Cut-off PHRED quality score for trimming reads from right end (3' end)
	For eg.: -q 20, will trim bases having PHRED quality score less than 20 at 3' end of the reads. 
	Note: Quality trimming can be performed only if -l and -r are not used. Default: 0

	qualCutOff=

	- Read length cut-off. Reads shorter than given length will be discarded. Default: -1 
 
	lenCutOff = 

	1.1.2. Filtering

	- The cut-off value for percentage of read length that should be of given quality. Default: 70

	cutOffReadLen4HQ = 70

	- The cut-off value for PHRED quality score for high-quality filtering. Default: 20

	cutOffQualScore = 30

1.2. Alignment Options.

	For mapping step bwa is used with default parameters for single and paired en reads. More info in the user 
	guide.

2. Variant Calling.

2.1 Samtools

	minMapQ = 40
	minPhredQ = 30

2.2 VarScan

	Somatic Mutation Calling comparing control and tumor samples is performed with default parameters.

2.3 GATK
	
	Use default options. See users guide for more information.

2.4 Strelka

	It has its own config.file, you will found it in /etc/configStrelka.ini

2.5 JointSNVMix

	min_normal_depth = 5 
	skip_size = 100 
	min_tumour_depth = 5
	model = snvmix2 
	somatic_threshold = 0.2

3. Variant Analysis: Variant Effect Predictor.This program needs the downloaded Ensembl database, look the user guide for
instructions. Put here the directory where the DB is placed (usually /home/{user}/.vep)

	cacheDir = /home/jalonso/.vep/
